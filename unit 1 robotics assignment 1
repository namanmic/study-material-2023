Define automation, and its advantages and disadvantages.?

Automation refers to the use of technology, such as computers and robots, to perform tasks that would otherwise be done by human workers. The main advantages of automation include increased efficiency and accuracy, as well as reduced labor costs. Automation can also allow for the performance of tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans to perform.
However, there are also some disadvantages to automation. One potential disadvantage is that it can lead to job loss for human workers, as their tasks are taken over by machines. Additionally, automation can be expensive to implement and maintain, and can also lead to a loss of certain skills and knowledge within a workforce. There is also the possibility that automation could lead to greater inequality between those who are able to work with the technology and those who are not.
What are common goal of automation. And also need of automation?
	The common goals of automation include increasing efficiency, reducing labor costs, improving accuracy and consistency, and performing tasks that are dangerous or difficult for humans to perform. Automation can also be used to improve production speed and capacity, and to reduce the need for human supervision.
The need for automation arises from the desire to improve the efficiency, productivity and quality of the process, by reducing human error, increasing speed and precision, and reducing labor costs. Automation can also help to improve safety, by removing the need for human workers to perform dangerous tasks. Additionally, automation can be used to perform tasks that are too complex for humans, such as monitoring and controlling large-scale industrial processes. Automation is also needed in some cases to meet the increasing demand for goods and services, as well as to remain competitive in the global market.

Discuss different types of automation and their advantage and disadvantages.?

There are several types of automation, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common types of automation include:
1.	Fixed Automation: This type of automation uses specialized equipment or machinery to perform a specific task or set of tasks. The advantage of fixed automation is that it can be highly efficient and accurate, and can also increase production speed and capacity. However, it can be expensive to set up and maintain, and may not be flexible enough to adapt to changing needs.
2.	Programmable Automation: This type of automation uses computer-controlled equipment or machinery that can be programmed to perform different tasks. The advantage of programmable automation is that it can be more flexible than fixed automation, and can adapt to changing needs. However, it can also be expensive to set up and maintain, and may not be as efficient as fixed automation.
3.	Flexible Automation: This type of automation uses a combination of specialized equipment and general-purpose machinery to perform a variety of tasks. The advantage of flexible automation is that it can be highly flexible and adaptable, and can also be less expensive than other types of automation. However, it may not be as efficient or accurate as fixed or programmable automation.
4.	Robotics: Robotics is type of automation that uses machines or robots to perform tasks that would normally be done by humans. The advantage of robotics is that it can be highly efficient, accurate, and precise, and can also perform tasks that are dangerous for humans. However, it can be expensive to set up and maintain, and may not be as adaptable as other types of automation.
5.	Artificial Intelligence (AI) : AI is a form of automation that can mimic human intelligence. It is used for decision making, problem solving, learning, and more. It can provide an advantage by making decisions on its own, reducing human error, and also increasing efficiency and productivity. However, it can be costly to implement and maintain, and also it may not be fully reliable in decision making if it is not trained on a diverse set of data.
6.	Cognitive Automation : cognitive automation is the combination of AI, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to automate complex process and decision making. It can provide an advantage by understanding the natural language and context of the process, and can also provide insights from unstructured data. However, it requires a huge amount of data for training, and also it may not be fully reliable if it is not trained on a diverse set of data.

What is difference between fixed automation and programmable automation?



Fixed automation and programmable automation are both types of automation that are used to perform tasks in a manufacturing or industrial setting. However, there are some key differences between the two:
Fixed Automation:
•	This type of automation uses specialized equipment or machinery to perform a specific task or set of tasks.
•	The equipment or machinery is designed to perform a specific function, and cannot be easily adapted to perform other tasks.
•	The equipment is hardwired, meaning the control logic is hardwired into the equipment and cannot be changed without modification.
•	This type of automation is highly efficient and accurate, and can increase production speed and capacity.
•	However, it can be expensive to set up and maintain, and may not be flexible enough to adapt to changing needs.
Programmable Automation:
•	This type of automation uses computer-controlled equipment or machinery that can be programmed to perform different tasks.
•	The equipment or machinery can be programmed to perform different functions, and can be easily adapted to perform other tasks.
•	The equipment is programmable, meaning the control logic is programmed into a computer or controller and can be changed without modification.
•	This type of automation is more flexible than fixed automation, and can adapt to changing needs.
•	However, it can also be expensive to set up and maintain, and may not be as efficient as fixed automation.
In summary, fixed automation is specialized, efficient, and accurate, but inflexible. Programmable automation is more flexible but less efficient, but also more adaptable to changing needs.

Discuss in brief about the USA principle of automation

The USA principle of automation is a set of guidelines for designing and implementing automation systems that are based on the principles of usability, safety, and adaptability.

Differentiate between hydraulics and pneumatics. Which one is advantageous and why? Explain

Hydraulics and pneumatics are both types of fluid power systems. However, they use different fluids and operate at different pressures.
Hydraulics use a liquid, typically oil, as the fluid. The oil is pressurized by a pump and then directed through valves and hoses to actuators, such as cylinders and motors, to perform work. Hydraulic systems are typically more powerful and efficient than pneumatic systems, because liquids are not compressible, they offer a more consistent and reliable force than gases.
Pneumatics use a gas, typically compressed air, as the fluid. The compressed air is directed through valves and hoses to actuators, such as cylinders and motors, to perform work. Pneumatic systems are typically less powerful than hydraulic systems, but they are simpler, cleaner and more reliable for certain applications.Which one is more advantageous depends on the specific application and requirements. For example, if high power density is required in a compact package, a hydraulic system would be more advantageous. On the other hand, if the application requires a clean, safe and simple system, a pneumatic system would be more advantageous.
It's also worth noting that the cost of operation and maintenance is usually lower in pneumatic systems due to the fact that it requires less energy to compress air than oil and air is readily available and relatively cheap.
